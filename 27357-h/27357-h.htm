<h3><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>


<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you will each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>

<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word [<i>in</i>] means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while [<i>off</i>] indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
[<i>off</i>, <i>coming in</i>] are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words [<i>mob</i>] or [<i>crowd
noise</i>] you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>It was in the month of December in 1620 that the Pilgrim
Fathers landed on Plymouth Rock and proceeded to establish
the first permanent white settlement in New England.
But the Pilgrims had not set out for America to establish
their new home in New England&mdash;far from it&mdash;they
had a charter permitting their settlement in the northern
portion of the Virginia plantation, and it was toward Virginia
that the little band of passengers aboard the Mayflower
thought they were heading. The story of how they
happened to come to the stern and rockbound coast of
New England and of how they happened to stay there and
carve out of the wilderness a great commonwealth is told
here.</p>

<p>Let us begin our story in Leyden, Holland, where for some
eleven years the Pilgrims have lived in exile from England,
driven out because of their religious faith. It is early in
the year 1620, and John Robinson, who is the pastor and
leader of the Pilgrims, is talking to John Carver, who is
one of the elders of the church.<!-- Page 2 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>No word yet from Elder Brewster?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nay, not a word. I fear me that he and Master Cushman
have found it impossible to raise such a large sum of
money.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>If we delay much longer King James may repent himself
of his generosity in allowing us to settle in Virginia.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I begin to fear that we are doomed to spend the rest of
our days in Holland.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Nay, nay, do not lose heart. Jehovah will find a way for
his children. Remember, the Children of Israel wandered
for forty years in the wilderness before they found rest in
the Promised Land.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I'll not lose faith, Pastor Robinson. I know a way will be
found for us. [<i>knock</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Will you see who's at the door?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Of course, Pastor. [<i>sound of opening door</i>] Good day to
you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Does Master John Robinson dwell here?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye. Will you enter?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Thank you.<!-- Page 3 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Pastor Robinson, this gentleman would speak with you.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Good morrow to you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Are you Pastor Robinson, then?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I am. And to what do I owe the honor of this visit, Master&mdash;ah&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>My name is Kieft, Wilhelm Kieft, at your service.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I am honored, Master Kieft. Allow me to present Master
Carver. [<i>they greet each other</i>]</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>And now to the business that brought me here&mdash;it is
rumored about Leyden that you and your company are
about to leave Leyden. Is that true?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>There is, as yet, nothing certain, Master Kieft.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>But you are planning an emigration to the New World,
are you not?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>It has been talked of, certainly, but thus far we have not
found the means.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Well, Master Robinson, perhaps I can find them for you.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed!<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Tell us, Master Kieft!</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I am a member of the Dutch West India Company, which
possesses a large tract of land in the New World.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed, I did not know that.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Ah, yes, through the discovery of a countryman of yours,
Henry Hudson, who sailed under our flag, we own the
country from the Great South River to the Great North
River, where, I am told, the climate is healthful and pleasant,
and the land rich and bountiful.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>And what do you propose to us?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>My company is prepared to furnish you land upon which
to found a colony, and capital to carry you and your
people there and support you until you have made yourselves
self-supporting.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And for this you would expect of us&mdash;what?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Some small share of your profits.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Yes, and what else?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Nothing, except that you should live under the Dutch flag
and make our claim to the land secure.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Your offer is generous, Master Kieft.<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And you make no other conditions than those you mention?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>None, I assure you.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Can you offer them in writing so that our people may consider
them?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Indeed, yes, if you are interested, my company will make
you a written offer within a fortnight.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We are interested, Master Kieft, very much so.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Good. You shall receive our conditions as soon as I can
arrange it. Good day!</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Good day, sir, and thank you.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Jehovah has heard our prayer. The way is open. Mayhap&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Is it not a generous offer?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Generous? Aye, but still&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I like it not.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed, and why not?<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Why should the Dutch West India Company make us such
a generous offer?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Why indeed, but that we may establish for them a colony
in the New World?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye, a colony that will give them a stronger hold upon
disputed land.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Do you think the land is disputed?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I know but little of the New World. I know not even
where the Great North River or the Great South River
may be, but only this I know: King James and his Virginia
Company would take it much amiss, that having a
patent to lands in Virginia, we turned to the Dutch and
settled under their flag.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And what has King James ever done for us but persecute
us, drive us from our homes, and make of us pilgrims upon
the face of the earth?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye, but I am an Englishman. I had looked with joy upon
our emigration to America, because I had hoped we could
once again live under British rule.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Many of our company have felt the same; but if we cannot
go except under the Dutch flag, still we must go.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye.<!-- Page 7 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>The hand of Jehovah leads us; we must follow.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So the offer of the Dutch West India Company was received
and in due course of time the provisions were put
into writing. The Pilgrim company discussed the offer
from every angle. All of them would have preferred to
settle under the British flag, if it could have been arranged,
but because more than six months had passed and they had
not found anyone who could finance them, they felt that
the Dutch offer should be accepted.</p>

<p>Therefore, near the end of February, 1620, Pastor Robinson
and Elder Carver meet with Wilhelm Kieft to settle
finally the matter of the emigration. Let us listen as they
talk together.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Two ships and one thousand pounds, which you can repay
in ten years.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And all your company demands is a monopoly in the fur
trade?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>That is all. Otherwise you shall do what pleases you; but
all of the fur must belong to the Dutch West India
Company.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>That seems just. What think you, Elder Carver?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Who shall govern us, Master Kieft?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You shall say that yourself. Who governs you now?<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We have no governor except the Elders of the Church.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>It shall be the same in the New World.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Do the terms satisfy you, Pastor Robinson?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed, I am more than satisfied.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Then shall we sign the articles? [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I can think of nothing more we should consider, can you,
Elder?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Then, if you have a quill, we can sign now. [<i>knock</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Your pardon, someone knocks.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>going</i>]</p>

<p>I'll see who it is.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Thank you, Elder. Ah, here is the quill. Now, where is
the inkhorn? Ah, yes, here.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Sign here. [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Let us wait for Elder Carver.<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Oh, Pastor Robinson?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Your pardon, sir, will you come here at once?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Thomas Weston of London desires to see you.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Can we not finish our business first?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Tell him to come in and sit down while we get this business
finished.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Will you come in, Master Weston?</p>

<p class="center">WESTON [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Thank you. Have I the honor of addressing Master Robinson?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I'm Robinson.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>I'm Thomas Weston, and I have come on behalf of a company
of London merchants&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>sharply</i>]</p>

<p>Master Robinson, your pardon, but may we not finish this
business in hand?<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Certainly! Elder Carver, Master Kieft is waiting for us
to sign the Articles of Emigration.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Your pardon, Master Robinson, did you say "Articles of
Emigration"?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Why, yes.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>I have an offer to make you for the emigration of your
company.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I must insist, sir&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>One moment, Master Kieft.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Are you going to sign or not?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Master Kieft, this may cause us to change our plans; we
must consider. What is your offer, Master Weston?</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>A company of seven London merchants has agreed to furnish
ships and capital to carry you and your people to
America.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You have already agreed with me<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We have signed nothing yet. Where, Master Weston, does
your company propose that we settle?</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>In northern Virginia&mdash;between the Great South River
and the Great North River.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>That, sir, is the land of the Dutch West India Company.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Your pardon, but King James has decreed&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>getting angrier</i>]</p>

<p>I care not what your sovereign may have decreed&mdash;he
has no claim to that land. My company discovered and
explored it!</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Has your company established any plantations there?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>That makes no difference.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Until you have established plantations, you cannot claim
it.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I do not wish to argue with you, sir. I am here to close
this business with you, Master Robinson. I am waiting&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We must have time to consider&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I had your word.<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Master Kieft, the situation has changed. We are Englishmen,
and if we can emigrate under our own flag, you cannot
blame us for preferring it to another.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You have tricked us&mdash;you are not treating me fairly!</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Now, sir&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>louder</i>]</p>

<p>And I warn you if you go to our land under the British
flag, you shall regret it, sir, you shall regret it. Good day!
[<i>sound of door slamming</i>]</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Thus the Pilgrims incurred the enmity of the Dutch West
India Company, and though the terms of the London merchants
were not so generous as those offered by the Dutch
company, the Pilgrims accepted them and set about making
their preparations for the great adventure.</p>

<p>They secured for their voyage two ships, the <i>Speedwell</i>
and the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>Our next scene is early in July of 1620. The <i>Mayflower</i>
has been engaged for the voyage, and is lying at anchor
in the Thames River off London, where it is undergoing
some repairs preparatory to taking on cargo, which is to
come to the New World. Aboard the ship is only the
master, Captain Jones, when he is disturbed by&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Ahoy, the <i>Mayflower</i>!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Ahoy! Who's hailing the <i>Mayflower</i>?<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Here&mdash;alongside! May I come aboard?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What do you want?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I want to talk to the master of the ship.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I'm master. What do you want?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>May I come aboard?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Come aboard. The ladder's over the side.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>All right, I'm coming. [<i>lower</i>] Keep the boat alongside!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir!</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>low</i>]</p>

<p>Stay here till I'm ready to leave!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Here you are&mdash;right up here, sir. Give me your hand!
Ah, there you are, sir!</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>in</i>]</p>

<p>Thank you, sir. Are you the master of the ship?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I am, sir.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I understand you are engaged for the voyage.<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>That we are, sir, to America.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Aye, yes&mdash;by a company of London merchants.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>And what's that to you, sir, begging your pardon?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>No matter, I know well enough you are. And now, sir,
I want to know if you'd like to put yourself in the way of
earning a hundred pounds?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>A hundred! Law, sir, and who wouldn't?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Exactly! I hoped I'd find you a man of sense.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What do you want me to do?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You are sailing for northern Virginia, are you not?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>That's the orders.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Where do you expect to make land?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I was looking to make it in the mouth of the Great North
River.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;you know, I suppose, that the Dutch West India
Company claims all the land bordering on the Great North
River.<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES [<i>laughing</i>]</p>

<p>Why, sir, everybody claims it. That's no matter. King
James has proclaimed that all the land that has been settled
belongs to them that has settled it; the rest is anybody's.
When the company I'm taking gets their plantation settled,
the Dutch can't claim the land any longer.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Perhaps not, but your company is not going to land on
Dutch territory.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You are going to lose your bearings&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Me&mdash;a sailor&mdash;lose my bearings?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Certainly&mdash;for one hundred pounds.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Well&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>And you will make land far to the north of the Great

<p>I'll have to see the color of the money.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Is it a bargain?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Have you got the money with you?<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I have, and on your promise, I'll pay it.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>All right. I'll see that the company is landed where you
wish.</p>

<p>Good!</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>And so Captain Jones of the <i>Mayflower</i> was bribed by
Dutch gold to play false with the band of Pilgrims. You
know the story of the long and difficult job the Pilgrims
had in getting fairly started on their voyage. The <i>Speedwell</i>
sprang a leak, and they had to put back to Plymouth
harbor where the ship was repaired. They made a second
start, and again the <i>Speedwell</i> became unseaworthy and
the captain refused to go on, so a second time the little
flotilla put back to Plymouth. This time, since the season
was far advanced and the Pilgrims feared that winter
would be upon them before they could get established in
their new home, the <i>Speedwell</i> was left behind, and on
September 16, 1620, the <i>Mayflower</i> left alone for the New
World. Halfway across the ocean the ship was beset by a
long series of storms, so severe that it took more than two
months for the ship to make the trip across the Atlantic.
At last, on the morning of November 20, 1620, the ship's
company were awakened by the electric cry of&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Land&mdash;ho! Land&mdash;land&mdash;ho!</p>

<p class="center">JONES [<i>calling</i>]</p>

<p>Where away?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Two points off the starboard bow!<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MOB [<i>voices swelling up</i>]</p>

<p>Land! Land! Is it really land?
Captain, Captain!
Have we really made land?
Land? [<i>etc.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, we've made land! Helmsman, bring the ship to bear
on land, dead ahead!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir, land dead ahead.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>coming up</i>]</p>

<p>Ah, Captain Jones, at last!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, at last&mdash;land ahead!</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Praise Jehovah!</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Praise Jehovah!
Amen! [<i>etc.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Captain, tell us, is this Virginia that lies before us?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I know not; I've not yet taken our bearings.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Do you not know where we are?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>How should I? We've been tossed about in storms for a
month, with no sun for days on end.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>There is sun this morning. Can you not take your bearings
now?<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The mate is figuring our position even now.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Captain Jones?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, mate, have you the position?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>I made it, sir, about seventy west by forty-two north.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Forty-two north&mdash;but, Captain, we are bound for forty
north&mdash;we're out of our course.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What do you expect&mdash;with the storms we've had?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Put your ship about&mdash;make for the south&mdash;this is not
Virginia!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>We'll land here.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>We have no right to land here. Our charter grants us land
in Virginia, not here!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I can't help that. The ship is in bad shape&mdash;I won't risk
sailing her any farther without repairs.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Very well, you may stop here for repairs, but we must go
on as soon as they are made.<!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>It will take some time.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>My people will help you. We must speed the work.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Of course, I'll speed it all I can, but a man can't do any
more than he can do.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Well, get to it at once&mdash;this very day! We must get
away from here within a fortnight or winter will be upon
us.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, so it will&mdash;and the winters in this country are bad.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then we must start south without delay.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Look you, Master Carver&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Well, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Belikes 'twill be a month or more before I can make the
<i>Mayflower</i> seaworthy&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>A month? Surely you can do better than that?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Perhaps not so well&mdash;why don't you land here?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Here?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye. 'Tis a goodly country&mdash;full as rich as Virginia.<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nay, nay, 'tis not to be thought on. We have a patent to
lands in Virginia&mdash;a charter to establish and rule a plantation
there; but here&mdash;why, the land is not ours&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>It is if you take it&mdash;it belongs to no one else.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But our Council would have no rights under the King&mdash;nay,
nay. We go on to Virginia&mdash;as soon as you have
made your repairs.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>So be it, Master Carver.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So the <i>Mayflower</i> brought up to anchor just inside Cape
Cod, near the present village of Provincetown. The
voyage had been long and arduous. There had been much
sickness aboard, and Captain Jones knew that most of the
passengers longed to set foot on solid ground and begin the
task of building their homes. So he determined to create
further dissatisfaction among them.</p>

<p>For our next scene we are going into Captain Jones's cabin
just as one of the five men of the company, Peter Brown,
has come into the cabin on the captain's invitation.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Sit you down, Master Brown, and find what comfort you
can in my poor quarters.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Poor! If this cabin is poor, Captain, what do ye call what
us folks has to put up with, all crowded into the common
cabin like sheep er worse?<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, 'tis too bad the cabin is not a better place for your
goodly company.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, well, we'll soon be out of it.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I fear me, not so soon.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Indeed, why?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The ship must be repaired before we can go on.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>How long will that take ye?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Mayhap two months or more, I know not.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Two months? Two months more in the cabin of this ship
and half of our company will be dead.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, belikes they will&mdash;and winter will be upon us hard
and heavy. The winters in this country are worse than
any you have ever seen in England or Holland.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The snow lies so deep it would cover a man's head&mdash;the
land is blotted out, and even the sea freezes&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Then how could we get ashore?<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I know not.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>And once ashore, how could we find a fair place to build
our homes?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>'Tis not for me to say.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Why can't we land right here, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Because your Elder, Master Carver, says fix the ship and
go on.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>If Elder Carver says that, then there be naught that we
kin do.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>You'd stay packed in the ship's cabin, facing sickness and
death, rather than rise up like men and tell the Elder what
you will and what you won't do, eh?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Elder Carver and the twelve masters have the voice; we
have naught to do but to obey.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Can it be that forty English freemen can't vote down
twelve masters?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Under our charter the freemen have no voice.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Under the charter, eh?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, so there's naught to do but what the masters say.<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Have you never heard of mutiny?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Mutiny? Nay, we be lawful men, bound together in the
love of Jehovah; we'll not mutiny! We must abide by our
charter.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The charter, aye.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>So there's naught to do&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Hold&mdash;have you thought on this&mdash;the charter binds you
under the King's grant in Virginia Plantation&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>And you are not in Virginia&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Nay, not yet.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>So you are not bound by the Virginia charter in these
waters.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Forsooth, Captain, I'd not thought on that.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>You have here all the rights of free-born Englishmen. And
if you rise like men and demand that your Elders hearken
to your voice, who shall gainsay you?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;who&mdash;who, indeed? If we vote to land here, 'tis
not mutiny.<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Nay, 'tis but your right, if you want to land here.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>We do&mdash;we do! Not a man in the company but would
stay here if he had his way.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Then have your way&mdash;like Englishmen! Go to your
cabin. Talk to the men of your company, tell them what
I have told you.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, Captain, I will! At once. [<i>going</i>]</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Good! [<i>sound of door closing</i>] [<i>to himself</i>] Well, Elder
Carver, we shall see whose voice is stronger&mdash;yours, or the
voice of forty English freemen!</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Thus Captain Jones planted in the mind of one of the
freemen of the Pilgrim company an idea which he was
sure would bear fruit before many hours. He watched
the company as first one man and then another fell in with
Peter Brown. He felt the temper of the company changing,
but he still did not feel that mutiny was likely against
the strong religious authority of the Elders. And so to
bring the matter to a head, he asked Carver to come to his
cabin. As the door closes, the captain begins&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I fear me, Master Carver, we are in a bad way.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Indeed&mdash;why?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The carpenter has gone over the ship timber by timber<!-- Page 25 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>It is a long, hard job we have before us.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Oh, too bad, too bad! How long?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What with finding the proper timbers ashore, and hewing
them to fit our needs, I fear it may well be two months or
more before we can leave these waters.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Surely you can make what repairs are necessary in less
time&mdash;you need not rebuild the ship.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Nay&mdash;but the ship is sprung at every seam; 'tis nothing
but good fortune that has kept it afloat so long.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>The seams sprung?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;all of them.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then our stores are in danger of being ruined.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, they are even now in such danger they should be unshipped.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then we must do it&mdash;set your crew to the work at once.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The crew has more than it can do to repair the ship and
make it ready to sail on to Virginia, since you insist on
going on.<!-- Page 26 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then I'll set our company to work on the stores&mdash;we
must not let them be ruined.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Nay, or you'll all face starvation, for you can count on
nothing from the land at this late date.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I'll gather the company together at once and set them to
work!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, do, Master Carver.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>We must unship the stores; [<i>going</i>] we'll begin at once.
[<i>sound of door opening</i>]</p>

<p class="center">JONES [<i>to himself</i>]</p>

<p>Mayhap your company will have something to say to that,
Master Carver.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So Carver gathered together his company in the common
cabin, and standing before the stern-faced, storm-weary
gathering, the Elder spoke:</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Men of the Pilgrim company, as no doubt you are all well
aware by now, the land we made this morning with such
joy and thanksgiving in our hearts is not the land of the
Virginia Plantation.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye, we know as much!
So we have heard. [<i>etc.</i>]<!-- Page 27 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But our ship is sore distressed from the buffeting of the
storms, and Captain Jones must needs make repairs before
we can sail on to our destination. [<i>protests and grumblings</i>]</p>

<p>I would it were not so, for I know how weary you find
yourselves after the many days upon the sea. But there's
naught else to do.</p>

<p class="center">PETER [<i>calling</i>]</p>

<p>Why can't we land here? [<i>mob assents</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nay, nay, it cannot be. This is not Virginia; we have no
patent to these lands. We must sail on. The captain and
his crew will make their repairs as soon as they can, but
our stores in the hold are all of them in danger of spoiling&mdash;so
we must needs unship them ourselves until such time
as we may sail away from here. So let every man prepare
himself for work.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Master Carver&mdash;we are not able to work. [<i>mob assents</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I know, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>And more&mdash;'tis not our wish to stay aboard this ship
longer&mdash;[<i>mob assents</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But we can do naught else&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, we kin land here, and find a goodly place to build our
homes and prepare against the winter that will be down
upon us long before we kin get to Virginia. [<i>mob agrees
heartily</i>]<!-- Page 28 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Men&mdash;men&mdash;quiet&mdash;hark to me! We've no right
under our charter to settle here!</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Then tear up the charter. [<i>mob agrees</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Tear up the charter? Have no government? Nay, we
can't do that!</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>We be freemen, Master Carver; we have a right to a voice
in what we'll do, and what we won't do&mdash;and we all want
to land here, don't we, men? [<i>all agree</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But if we make our home here, we are outside the King's
rule.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>We'll rule ourselves&mdash;we be free-born Englishmen! [<i>all
agree</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Mayhap&mdash;if that is your wish&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>It is!</p>

<p>Aye, aye! [<i>etc.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>It may be for the best interest of the company and for the
glory of Jehovah. I consent to your wishes. [<i>cheers</i>]
But it behooves us to enter into a compact, one with the
other&mdash;that no man may say, once we have landed in New
England, that we have no law and cannot punish the disobedient.<!-- Page 29 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>May it please ye, sir, we be more than willing for the masters
to write a compact that all can sign to be governed
like any free-born Englishmen by the will o' the majority&mdash;[<i>all
agree</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>So be it&mdash;let the masters of the company join me in my
cabin, and we shall make a compact joining all the company
of freemen into a body politic. [<i>cheers</i>]</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>And so in the cabin of the <i>Mayflower</i> the masters of the
company, twelve in number, met in the first American
legislative assembly and drew up one of the most famous
documents in American history&mdash;the Mayflower Compact&mdash;which
organized the first self-governing community
in the New World.</p>
